## Introduction

**SeniorTalk** is a comprehensive, open-source Mandarin Chinese speech dataset specifically designed for research on  elderly aged 75 to 85. This dataset addresses the critical lack of publicly available resources for this age group, enabling advancements in automatic speech recognition (ASR), speaker verification (SV), speaker dirazation (SD), speech editing and other related fields.  The dataset is released under a **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license**, meaning it is available for non-commercial use.

## Dataset Details

This dataset contains 55.53 hours of high-quality speech data collected from 202 elderly across 16 provinces in China. Key features of the dataset include:

*   **Age Range:**  75-85 years old (inclusive).  This is a crucial age range often overlooked in speech datasets.
*   **Speakers:** 202 unique elderly speakers.
*   **Geographic Diversity:** Speakers from 16 of China's 34 provincial-level administrative divisions, capturing a range of regional accents.
*   **Gender Balance:**  Approximately 7:13 representation of male and female speakers, largely attributed to the differing average ages of males and females among the elderly.
*   **Recording Conditions:**  Recordings were made in quiet environments using a variety of smartphones (both Android and iPhone devices) to ensure real-world applicability.
*   **Content:**  Natural, conversational speech during age-appropriate activities.  The content is unrestricted, promoting spontaneous and natural interactions.
*   **Audio Format:**  WAV files with a 16kHz sampling rate. 
*   **Transcriptions:**  Carefully crafted, character-level manual transcriptions.  
* **Annotations:** The dataset includes annotations for each utterance, and for the speakers level.
    *   **Session-level**:  `sentence_start_time`,`sentence_end_time`,`overlapped speech`
    *   **Utterance-level**:  `id`, `accent_level`, `text` (transcription).
    *   **Token-level**:   `special token`([SONANT],[MUSIC],[NOISE]....)
    *   **Speaker-level**: `speaker_id`, `age`, `gender`, `location` (province), `device`.
      

### Dataset Structure

## Dialogue Dataset


The dataset is split into two subsets:
| Split      | # Speakers | # Dialogues | Duration (hrs) | Avg. Dialogue Length (h) |
| :--------- | :--------: | :----------: | :------------: | :-----------------------: |
| `train`    |    182     |    91    |     49.83     |           0.54            |
| `test`     |     20     |    10     |      5.70      |           0.57            |
| **Total**  |  **202**   |  **101**  |   **55.53**   |       **0.55**           |



The dataset file structure is as follows.
```

dialogue_data/  
â”œâ”€â”€ wav  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ train/*.tar   
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test/*.tar   
â””â”€â”€ transcript/*.txt
UTTERANCEINFO.txt  # annotation of topics and duration
SPKINFO.txt   # annotation of location , age , gender and device
```
Each WAV file has a corresponding TXT file with the same name, containing its annotations.

| **Total**  |  **202**   |  **60,029**  |   **37.81**   |       **2.27**           |


The dataset file structure is as follows.
```
sentence_data/  
â”œâ”€â”€ wav  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ train/*.tar
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dev/*.tar
